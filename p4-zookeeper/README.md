# 281 Project 4 ZooKeeper

Found an optimal path to route water and feed zoo animals based on wild and domestic zones. 
Implemented Prim's algorithm to create MSTs which helped in a heuristic algorithm that would find a suboptimal path.

Implemented the branch and bound algorithm to find the most optimal path, using MSTs as a base.
